# Comparison Between UDP and TCP

| Feature              | UDP (User Datagram Protocol)                           | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Connection Type      | Connectionless                                        | Connection-oriented                                |
| Reliability          | Unreliable (no guarantee of delivery)                | Reliable (ensures delivery with acknowledgments)  |
| Ordering              | No guaranteed order of delivery                       | Guarantees order of delivery                       |
| Speed                | Faster due to no connection establishment overhead     | Slower due to connection establishment and checks  |
| Header Size          | 8 bytes                                              | 20-60 bytes                                       |
| Flow Control         | No flow control                                       | Flow control through windowing                     |
| Use Cases            | Suitable for applications like streaming, gaming      | Suitable for applications requiring reliability, like web browsing and file transfers |
| Error Checking       | Basic checksum for error checking                     | Comprehensive error checking with retransmissions  |

### Conclusion

UDP is preferred for speed-sensitive applications, while TCP is used when reliability and order are crucial.
