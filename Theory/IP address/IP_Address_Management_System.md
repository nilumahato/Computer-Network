# Designing a System for IP Address Management

## Question:

Design a system to manage or assign IP addresses.

## Answer:

### IP Address Management System Design

#### Components:

1. **IP Address Pool Management:**
   - Maintain a pool of available IP addresses categorized as public or private.
   - Track IP address allocation and availability.

2. **DHCP Server Integration:**
   - Implement Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers for automatic IP address assignment within local networks.
   - Configure DHCP scopes and options (subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers) for IP address allocation.

3. **Static IP Address Assignment:**
   - Allow manual assignment of static IP addresses for servers, printers, and critical network devices.
   - Ensure no overlap with DHCP-assigned IP addresses.

4. **IP Address Reservation:**
   - Reserve specific IP addresses within DHCP scopes for devices requiring consistent IP assignments (e.g., servers).

5. **Network Address Translation (NAT):**
   - Manage NAT mappings for internal private IP addresses to a single or multiple public IP addresses for internet communication.

6. **IP Address Tracking and Monitoring:**
   - Monitor IP address usage and conflicts.
   - Track lease durations for DHCP-assigned addresses and manage IP address renewals.

7. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement security measures like DHCP snooping to prevent rogue DHCP servers.
   - Secure management interfaces and access to IP address management tools.

8. **Scalability and Redundancy:**
   - Design for scalability to handle growing network demands and additional IP address requirements.
   - Implement redundancy for DHCP servers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

#### Workflow:

- **IP Address Assignment Process:**
  - DHCP clients broadcast DHCP Discover messages to request IP addresses.
  - DHCP servers respond with DHCP Offer messages containing available IP addresses.
  - Clients select and request IP addresses with DHCP Request messages.
  - Servers confirm IP address assignment with DHCP Acknowledge (DHCPACK) messages.

#### Example Implementation:

```text
- Use of DHCP servers to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices in a corporate network.
- NAT configuration to map internal private IP addresses to a single public IP address for internet access.
- Reservation of static IP addresses for critical servers and devices requiring consistent network configuration.
