## What is Private and Public IP Address?

## Private IP Address

A private IP address is a range of non-routable IP addresses used within a private network. These addresses are not accessible directly from the internet. Public IP addresses, on the other hand, are routable on the internet and are assigned by ISPs to devices or networks to enable communication over the internet.
## Private IP Address Ranges

   **Class A:** 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
   **Class B:** 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
   **Class C:** 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

## Public IP Addresses

Public IP addresses are unique across the entire internet and are assigned to devices or networks by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) through ISPs.

## Differences Between Private and Public IP Addresses
| Feature           | Private IP Address                                         | Public IP Address                             |
| **Accessibility** | Used within private networks, not routable on the internet | Routable on the internet, accessible globally |
| **Assignment**    | Assigned manually or automatically within a private network | Assigned by ISPs or organizations for public use |
| **Network Scope** | Limited to a specific private network                       | Global scope, accessible from anywhere        |
| **Address Space** | Can be reused within different private networks             | Unique across the entire internet              |
| **Security**      | Provides an additional layer of security within a network   | Requires additional security measures to protect against unauthorized access |

## How Private and Public IP Addresses Work Together

Private and public IP addresses work together using Network Address Translation (NAT). NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address for accessing the internet.

## How NAT Works

   1. **Device Communication** : Devices within a private network communicate using private IP addresses. 
   2. **NAT Gateway:** When a device needs to access the internet, its private IP address is translated to a public IP address by a NAT gateway (usually a router).
   3. **Internet Access:** The translated public IP address is used for communication over the internet.
   4. **Returning Traffic:** The NAT gateway translates incoming traffic from the internet back to the corresponding private IP address.

## Benefits of NAT

   **Address Conservation** : Allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address, conserving the limited number of available public IP addresses.
   **Security** : Hides the internal network structure from the internet, providing an additional layer of security.

## Summary

   - **Private IP Address:**: Used within private networks, non-routable on the internet.
   - **Public IP Address:** Routable on the internet, assigned by ISPs for global communication.
   - **NAT:** Enables multiple private IP addresses to share a single public IP address, conserving public IPs and enhancing security.
